# DHCP-Flood-Attack
A DHCP Flood Attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack that targets the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. The attacker overwhelms the DHCP server by sending a large number of DHCPDISCOVER requests, causing the server to allocate all available IP addresses, making it unavailable for legitimate users.
